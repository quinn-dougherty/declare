# `nixos-gaming`

Not a whole ton of overlap between nixos and lutris communities, but stuff is mostly transferable.

A lot of what I do is specific to XE/Tigerlake iGPU, though.

## TODO:

- [ ] Finish `factorio` build using `agenix` for key (`pull/21`).
- [ ] Make `lutris battlenet` a nixos module, for importing.
- [ ] Write up, including frametime/stutter mitigation (much of this will be `framework` specific).
- [ ] Initialize `nixos-gaming` repo (after importable module version of battlenet).
