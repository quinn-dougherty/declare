We like to reduce opacity for unfocused windows sometimes.

[ ] TODO: a =.patch= file to disable unfocused window opacity. For the
time being, do these steps manually:

- comment out =, logHook = fadeInactiveLogHook unfocusedWindowOpacity=
  in =xmonad.hs=
- comment out =xcompmgr -cn &= in =xprofile= (perhaps delete if comments
  are not allowed)
- comment out =xorg.xcompmgr= in =framework/modules/x.nix=

** Screensavers
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: screensavers

[ ] TODO: a =.patch= file to enable screensavers. For the time being, do
these steps manually

- Add =xscreensaver= to =framework/modules/x.nix=
- Add something like =xscreensaver &= to =xprofile=
