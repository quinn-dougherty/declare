| `fixpoint` | daily driver (framework 13 batch 5)           |
|  `yoneda`  | hercules ci, jellyfin, vaultwarden (onprem)   |
|  `cofix`   | just `homeManagerConfiguration` for a Manjaro |

There's a bunch of dead code in here, inactive modules and even inactive hosts.

## Developer shells

I have very basic shells for modest and generic projects in rust, js, python, coq, ocaml, haskell. Suitable for bootstrapping.

```sh
nix develop github:quinn-dougherty/declare#rust
nix develop github:quinn-dougherty/declare#python
```

Including for monorepos of up to three different kits (these are examples, but you can use any permutation of the 6)

```sh
nix develop github:quinn-dougherty/declare#python-ocaml
nix develop github:quinn-dougherty/declare#js-rust
nix develop github:quinn-dougherty/declare#haskell-coq-js
nix develop github:quinn-dougherty/declare#python-rust-js
```

The shells are the only aspect of these repo that's vendored for direct usage.
